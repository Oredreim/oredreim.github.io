Thanks to `nmap` and `whatweb` we know that the `80 port` is running `HttpFileServer httpd 2.3` So, we can now use `searchsploit` to see if there is any vulnerability and explotation of it.

#### Vulnerabilities

searchsploit HttpFileServer 2.3

Ok, lets take a look to the vulnerabilty.

<img src="/assets/img/optimum/1.png">

After read the script, we can see that the vulnerability has `remote command execution`. Its a python script and also has the way to use it.

`# Usage :  python3 Exploit.py <RHOST> <Target RPORT> <Command>`

But there is something rare, cause when I try to execute the command it fails.

So lets keep watching, and looks like we most call the command we want from the path
`powershell.exe`
`c:\windows\SysNative\WindowsPowershell\v1.0\powershell.exe`

## Shell as kostas

Ok, we now know that we can execture commands on the machine. But we need a reverse shell now.

Searching we find a github repository `nishang` there are so many things to exploit vulnerabilities, but we are looking for `Invoke-PowerShellTcp.ps1` we are gonna open a server thanks to `python -m http.server 80` and we are gonna share this file, when this file is inside the machine, it will execute the file and then we got a revershell.

But its not that simple, lets change the file a littlebit

<img src="/assets/img/optimum/2.png">

we are gonna put this command at the end of the file, so, when the script is executing and is finishing it will do that command and give us the reverse shell.

## Shell as System

#### Enumeration
<img src="/assets/img/optimum/4.png">

Doing a `systeminfo` we now have the information about the system, but reading it I find nothing, so we can use `sherlock` or `watson` to find some vulnerabilities with this information, or we can drop `winpeas` at the system and it will give us more information too.

Then we find what we need.

```bash
MSBulletin : MS16-098 
```

Now, we have the name. lets take a look at `exploit-db` and see what we got. Actually it give us the link to the exploit.

After reading the exploit, we notice that it as and ID, so I now `offensive-security` have a repository on github where they have explotations, lets find the `41020.exe`.

We just need to drop the file inside the machine and thats it.

We are now Administrator.
