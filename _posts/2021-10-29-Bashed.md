#### Website - TCP Port 80

Looks like at the page is nothing, just information, lets keep enumerate.

#### Directory Brute Force
Ok, thanks to `wfuzz` we got some directory listing.

Now, looking on the directories, there are some interesting, `dev, uploads, php`. Actually all of them are really interesting. But the one I'm using is `dev`.

Inside this directory are some files, `phpbash.min.php` is the important one. Cause if execute this file, it give us a shell.

Ok, we have a shell, but i dont like it like this, I prefer a `reverse shell`.

## Shell as Root
#### Enumeration
Using the common command `sudo -l` to check the privilenge `www-data` have. We find out we dont need password to change to user.

 Then after looking the files on the machine, there is a directory really interesting named `scripts`.

#### Privilege Scalation
Looks like, there is a `python` script, and an output of it. So, think and watching, the script is run by root, and we have access and can manipulate the file. so lets change this script.
